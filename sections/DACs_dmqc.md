# Delayed Mode Quality Control

## Sensor drift and biofouling
Biofouling on the glider can affect the angle of attack, mass and drag coefficient, hence the DAC.

At the end of the mission, the calibration can be checked again to check for sensor drift. 
A simulation mission can also be done at various headings (e.g every 45Â°) to obtain a post-calibration curve that can be applied in DM.
