# Pre-deployment operations and calibrations

## Battery degaussing
Degaussing battery packs before installation is recommended. 
After each degaussing of the battery pack, a careful compass calibration needs to be performed in order to take into account the change in the magnetic environment where the compass is located.

## Ballasting requirements
Vehicle: 
- Good ballast to ensure stable flight
- Record accurate mass

### Seaglider
We used to rely on pre-deployment compass calibrations but now perform it in-situ running two back-to-back dives at the start of the deployment using 2 different pitch and roll combinations.  
We return the collected magnetometer data, then process it offline and upload a hard-iron and soft-iron correction file.  
Eliminates the problem of subsequent hard-iron distortion caused by large magnetic objects like ships and rocks.  
We also measure any residual hard-iron distortions due to battery pack locations and correct for that (typically none on Seaglider, somewhat present for Deepglider).
