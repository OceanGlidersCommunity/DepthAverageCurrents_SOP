# Introduction

This standard operational practice (SOP) document for Depth Averaged Currents (DACs) aims to guide the user through the whole glider preparation, deployment, recovery and data processing cycle. 
It aims to result in high quality data and further ensures a data flow both for real time data delivery and long term data archiving.
